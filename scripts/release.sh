# Build CLEAN. An incremental build reuses whatever SwiftPM already resolved
# into build/SourcePackages — so after an SDK repin it can silently produce a
# bundle stamped with the PREVIOUS generation, which the host then refuses to
# load. That happened: a release went out declaring generation 7 against a
# generation-8 SDK. A release build is not the place to save 90 seconds.

# Signed BEFORE zipping, deliberately: the catalog verifies the sha256 of the

#
# WHY this is not optional any more. The host's
# `PluginTrust.policyForCurrentBuild()` demands a Developer-ID signature on
# every plugin as soon as THE HOST ITSELF carries one. While the host was
# ad-hoc it fell back to `DevModeSignaturePolicy` and accepted anything --
# which is why these scripts never signed. A Developer-ID host plus an ad-hoc
# plugin means the plugin is REJECTED before `Bundle.load()`, and Ainkrad looks
# like it simply has no apps.

  # Captured into a variable rather than piped into `grep -q`. Under
